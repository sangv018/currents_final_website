            ABOUT MY BOOKS      
        </h1>

        <h2>
            Both my books were created on the topic of dictance and the comfort of home. They are two different intterations of the same topic that map out my location travelled each day consecutively. The purpose was to depict how my day starts and ends at a place that I call home. I used the app Life360 to gather my data and have been recording this for a couple of months now.

            I have also added the videos of what my physical book looks like below!
